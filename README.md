# Capstone Project 2 - NBA Player Statistic Analysis and Prediction

## Location of Code for Parts of the Project

### Data Wrangling

- Data used in analysis is contained in 3 different datasets: game_details (contains player boxscores), games (contains team boxscores), players (contains player ids and player info)
- All code for merging and creating new variables for these datasets is contained in jupyter notebook CapStone Project 2 - Data Wrangling.ipynb 

### Data StoryTelling
- All code that answers the following questions using descriptive statistics are contained in the jupyter notebook Capstone Project 2 - Data Storytelling.ipynb:

1) Which players score the most points?

2) Which positions do players play that score the most points?

3) How has scoring changed for Centers over the years?

4) How can player development and player movement impact points scored?

### Hypothesis Testing
- All code that answers the following questions using inferential statistics are contained in the jupyter notebook CapStone Project 2 - Inferential Statistics.ipynb:

1) Is there a significant difference in the average points scored between positions (Guard, Forward, Center)

2) Is there a significant difference in the scoring averages of players playing for playoff teams vs. players playing for non playoff teams

### Model Prediction
- All code for the baseline modeling (OLS-Ordinary Least Squares) which uses historical data to predict the number of points Lebron James (played most games in the dataset) and Giannis Antetokounmpo will score in upcoming games is contained in the jupyter notebook Capstone Project 2 - Baseline Modeling.ipynb
- All code for the extended models which include the Random Forest Regressor and the XGBoost Regressor for prediction of the above players are included in the jupyter notebook Capstone Project 2 - Extended Modeling.ipynb
